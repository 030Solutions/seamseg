Seamless Scene Segmentation is a CNN-based architecture that can be trained end-to-end to predict a complete class- and
instance-aware labeling of each pixel in an image. To tackle this task, also known as "panoptic segmentation", we take
advantage of a novel segmentation head that seamlessly integrates multi-scale features generated by a Feature Pyramid
Network with contextual information conveyed by a light-weight DeepLab-like module.
